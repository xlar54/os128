                        ; pointer with the address of the location from which the byte is to be retrieved (or the base location if 
                        ; a series of bytes are to be retrieved). Call the routine with the accumulator holding the address of the
                        ; zero-page pointer, the X register holding the bank number (0-15) for the target location, and the Y register
                        ; holding an offset value which will be added to the address in the pointer to determine the location from which
                        ; the byte is to be loaded. (Load Y with zero if no offset is desired.) Upon return, the accumulator will hold
                        ; the byte from the specified address. The value in the Y register will be preserved during the routine. If you
                        ; are retrieving data from a series of locations, it is necessary to reload the accumulator and X registers with
                        ; the pointer address and bank number before every call to this routine, but you can read up to 256 sequential
                        ; locations without changing the address in the zeropage pointer by simply incrementing the Y register between calls.

INDSTA     = $FF77      ; STA (stavec),Y to any bank

                        ; (or the base location if a series of bytes is to be stored); then store the address of this pointer in

                        ; (Load Y with zero if no offset is desired.) Upon return, the accumulator will still hold the byte value.

                        ; is to be compared (or the base location if a series of bytes are to be compared); then store the address of
                        ; this pointer in location 712/$02C8. Call the routine with the accumulator holding the byte to be compared,
                        ; the X register holding the bank number (0-15) for the target location, and the Y register holding an offset
                        ; value which will be added to the address in the pointer to determine the location with which the byte is to
                        ; be compared. (Load Y with zero if no offset is desired.) Upon return, the accumulator will still hold the byte
                        ; value, and the status register N, Z, and C (carry) bits will reflect the result of the comparison. The value
                        ; in the Y register will also be preserved. If you are comparing a series of locations, it is necessary to reload
                        ; the X register with the bank number before every call to this routine, but you can compare up to 256 sequential
